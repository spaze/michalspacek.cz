# Reporting a Vulnerability

This is my personal site but if you find a bug please file a new issue, report the bug privately via GitHub, or let me know.
I don't offer bounties for security bugs but I'll buy you a beer or make a donation to a charity of your choice (which you can then match if you want).
You can find my contacts for example in [security.txt](https://www.michalspacek.cz/.well-known/security.txt) ([*what's that?*](https://www.michalspacek.com/what-is-security.txt-and-why-you-should-have-one)) or elsewhere.
