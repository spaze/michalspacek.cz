## Installation

Preferred way to install spaze/mysql-session-handler is by using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
$ composer require spaze/mysql-session-handler
```

## Setup

After installation:

1) Create the table sessions using SQL in [sql/create.sql](sql/create.sql).

2) Register an extension in config.neon:

```neon
	extensions:
		sessionHandler: Spaze\Session\DI\MysqlSessionHandlerExtension
```

## Features

- For security reasons, Session ID is stored in the database as an SHA-256 hash.
- Supports encrypted session storage via [spaze/encryption](https://github.com/spaze/encryption) which uses [paragonie/halite](https://github.com/paragonie/halite) which uses [Sodium](https://php.net/sodium).
- Events that allow you to add additional columns to the session storage table for example.
- Multi-Master Replication friendly (tested in Master-Master row-based replication setup).

## Encrypted session storage

Follow the guide at [spaze/encryption](https://github.com/spaze/encryption#usage-in-nette-framework) to define a new encryption key.

Define a new service:
```
sessionEncryption: \Spaze\Encryption\Symmetric\StaticKey('session', %encryption.keys%, %encryption.activeKeyIds%)
```

Add the new encryption service to the session handler:
```
sessionHandler:
    encryptionService: @sessionEncryption
```

Migration from unecrypted to encrypted session storage is not (yet?) supported.

## Events

### `onBeforeDataWrite`
The event occurs before session data is written to the session table, both for a new session (when a new row is inserted) or an existing session (a row us updated). The event is not triggered when just the session timestamp is updated without any change in the session data.

You can add a new column by calling `setAdditionalData()` in the event handler:
```
setAdditionalData(string $key, $value): void
```
Use it to store for example user id to which the session belongs to.
